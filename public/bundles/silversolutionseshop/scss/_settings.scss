// We use this file in case we would like to include our settings in another file
// like we did for dashboard. Using this approach we can reorder positions and add new
// settings in one place and never forget to update in any other place

@import "settings/global";

// Duplicated vendor/foundation/scss/foundation/_settings.scss
// It is duplicated and not imported for easier update process
@import "settings/foundation";

// Settings that are not part of Foundation framework
// Feel free to override this file in your project
@import "settings/storm";
